// Walking the DOM 

// DOM tree refers to the HTML page where all the nodes are objects. There can be 3 main types of nodes in the DOM tree:

// 1.text nodes
// 2.element nodes
// 3.comment nodes
 
// In an HTML page, <html> is at the root and <head> and <body> are its children, etc.

// A text node is always a leaf of the tree.

 

// Auto correction
// If an erroneous HTML is encountered by the browser, it tends to correct it. 
// For example, if we put something after the body, it is automatically moved 
// inside the body. Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody>

// </tbody>
